REST is the way HTTP should be used. 

HTTP is an application protocol. REST is a set of rules, that when followed, enable you to build a distributed application 
that has a specific set of desirable constraints.

REST doesn't add any specific functionality to HTTP but is an architectural style that was developed alongside HTTP 
and most commonly uses HTTP for its application layer protocol.

Today we only use a tiny bit of the HTTP protocol's methods â€“ namely GET and POST. 
The REST way to do it is to use all of the protocol's methods.
For example, REST dictates the usage of DELETE to erase a document (be it a file, state, etc.) behind a URI, 
whereas, with HTTP, you would misuse a GET or POST query like ...product/?delete_id=22.
